**Sprint Review and Retrospective:**
**Sprint Review**

**Project Overview**
The SNHU Travel project was developed to provide an online application for booking and managing travel plans. The goal was to create a user-friendly platform that met client needs while piloting the Scrum-Agile process at ChadaTech.

**Sprint Goal**
Deliver a functional increment of the travel booking software that reflects core user stories, demonstrates Agile teamwork, and showcases how the Scrum framework supports development.

**What Was Completed**
Created initial user stories to represent customer needs (e.g., booking travel, managing preferences).
Designed test cases based on those user stories to ensure features aligned with user expectations.
Implemented core development work on the booking system, with flexibility to adjust scope as priorities shifted.
Facilitated Scrum events (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Backlog Refinement, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective) to keep the team aligned and transparent.

**Demonstration**
The sprint increment demonstrated how user needs could be translated into user stories, tested through clear acceptance criteria, and delivered as functional features.

**Applying Roles**
Each role contributed to the success of the project:
Scrum Master: Facilitated events, removed blockers, and ensured team communication stayed transparent.
Product Owner: Collected user needs, translated them into user stories, and prioritized backlog items.
Tester: Interpreted user stories to develop test cases and communicated gaps back to the team.
Developer: Built features, requested clarifications, and demonstrated flexibility in response to changing requirements.

**Completing User Stories**
The Scrum-Agile approach allowed user stories to be completed incrementally. For example, writing user stories in the format “As a traveler, I want to [goal], so that [benefit]” gave the team a clear understanding of what to deliver. Testers then validated these features against acceptance criteria, ensuring completion.

**Handling Interruptions**
When priorities shifted (such as stakeholder feedback requiring changes), the Scrum framework allowed the team to adapt by refining the backlog and adjusting sprint focus. This flexibility prevented interruptions from derailing progress.

**Communication**
Communication was maintained through Scrum events and direct updates:
Stand-ups provided quick status checks.
Emails to the Product Owner/tester clarified requirements.
Documentation updates created a shared reference point.
These practices encouraged collaboration and reduced misunderstandings.

**Organizational Tools**
Scrum events and Agile tools improved organization:
Backlog Refinement kept priorities clear.
Sprint Planning ensured achievable goals.
Retrospectives supported continuous improvement.
If tools such as JIRA or Trello had been used, they would have further enhanced visibility and coordination.

**Evaluating Agile Process**
Pros:
Allowed flexibility when requirements changed.
Encouraged constant communication and collaboration.
Provided working increments quickly for review and feedback.
Cons:
Required more frequent coordination than a traditional process.
Estimating effort for user stories was sometimes challenging.

**Overall Effectiveness:**
The Scrum-Agile approach was highly effective for the SNHU Travel project. It supported adaptability, emphasized user needs, and fostered strong communication across roles. Compared to a waterfall approach, Scrum provided faster feedback and better alignment with stakeholder priorities.


**README:**
**Q.** How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

**A.** Interpreting user needs begins with understanding the problem from the user’s perspective. This often involves gathering requirements, asking clarifying questions, and identifying what features provide the most value. User stories are a key tool in this process because they frame requirements in terms of user goals rather than technical details. By writing stories in the format “As a [user], I want [functionality], so that [goal],” I can focus on building features that directly address real needs. This also helps ensure that development remains user-centered and prioritizes value over unnecessary complexity.

**Q.** How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

**A.** When developing programs, I break down large problems into smaller, manageable tasks. Agile processes such as iterative development, sprint planning, and retrospectives help me stay organized and continuously improve. I especially value the feedback loop created by sprint reviews, where progress is demonstrated and stakeholders can provide input. In my future work, I hope to continue using Agile practices like daily stand-ups, backlog grooming, and retrospectives to ensure steady progress, adaptability, and collaboration with my team.

**Q.** What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

**A.** Being a good team member means more than just writing good code. It requires clear communication, accountability, and a willingness to collaborate. Good team members actively listen to others, provide constructive feedback, and support their teammates when challenges arise. In Agile development, this also means being flexible and open to change, since priorities can shift quickly. Ultimately, a good team member contributes not only to the success of the project but also to a positive and productive team environment.
